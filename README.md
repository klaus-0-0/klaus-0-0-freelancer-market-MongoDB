Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>

2. Backend Setup
cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file:
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/freelancer
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret


Start the backend:
npm main.js

3. Frontend Setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev


Authentication Flow
On login/signup, the backend sets a JWT inside an HTTP-only cookie

The frontend sends requests using:
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;

The browser automatically attaches cookies to API requests
Backend reads the token from req.cookies
Real-Time Bidding Flow
Freelancer joins a Socket.IO room using their ID
Client places a bid
Backend emits a new-bid event to the freelancer’s room
Freelancer dashboard updates instantly

Theme Management (Context API)
Theme state (light/dark) is handled using React Context API
Theme is globally available across the app
No prop drilling
Easy to extend for more UI preferences

Notes

No localStorage is used for authentication
